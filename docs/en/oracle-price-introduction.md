### Connect your smart contract with the real world

The pricing oracle machine is the fastest way to connect your smart contract with the market price of digital assets. This allows your smart contract to obtain the latest market price of the digital asset with one call.

### Obtain the latest digital asset prices

The operation of a smart contract usually requires the acquisition of real-time quotation information of a certain digital asset as a basis.

For example: within a mortgage smart contract, each mortgaging action requires the latest quotation information of the mortgaged item.
